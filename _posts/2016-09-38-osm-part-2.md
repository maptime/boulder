This is Part 2 of our 3 Part OSM Series.... the data 

_If you didn't make it to part 1 last month... don't worry, you should still come!_

If you have a favorite map / project that uses OSM data, comment here, and we'll share them to kick off the meeting!

After that, we'll be going through a few different methods of extracting/obtaining OSM data and some of the neat things you can do with it.

If you'd like to follow along, please bring your computer, I hope this will be a hands-on interactive demo. We'll likely use QGIS, so if you don't have that installed yet, you can do so here: [https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)



## Resources We'll Be Using

1. [Mapzen's Metro Extracts](https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/):
  - Up-to-date extracts of various cities across the world.
  - You can also request extracts for custom areas.

2. [Overpass Turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu/)
  - A powerful query tool built against the Overpass API to extract specific data.

3. [Locally in QGIS](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/QGIS#QGIS2_OpenStreetMap_Vectors)
  - Recent versions of QGIS can pull the data in. This may or may not be separate from the [QuickOSM Plugin](http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QuickOSM/)

4. Does anybody else use a different tool?
