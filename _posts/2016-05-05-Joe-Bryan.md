What is community mapping? How do you do it?  What is it good for?  These are some of the questions that we will work through these questions in more.  We will use housing in Boulder as a topic to ground our efforts.

This will be a hands-on, mixed media event so bring whatever you will need to make a map!

Presenter: Joe Bryan, Assistant Professor, Geography, CU Boulder

Joe has worked on participatory mapping projects with indigenous peoples in the US, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Mexico.  In addition to his work with communities, he is the co-author with Denis Wood of Weaponizing Maps: Indigenous Peoples and Counterinsurgency, along with numerous articles on indigenous politics and participatory mapping.
