• What we'll do

Interested in learning how to edit in OpenStreetMap and contributing to a humanitarian project? Join us for creating geospatial data where it's needed on the globe! As April 5th gets closer, we'll select an appropriate HOTOSM.org task to work on and post the project choice here. Stay tuned!

• What to bring

A laptop and and a mouse (the latter makes editing geospatial data easier, but it isn't necessary).
