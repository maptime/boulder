For our last Maptime of 2016, we're going to recap the year in Maps! It can be a map you made, a map you saw, a map you bought, any map!

All types of maps are welcome! Handmade, Re-Made, Paper, Digital, Web, Interactive, Static, or Tattooed. Bring your map in hand or share the web-address in the comments below and we'll share!

Please note that we're meeting on a Monday, different from our normal Wednesday times. This is because the Drone Mapping meetup is in Denver on Wednesday, so be sure to check that out if you're interested!
