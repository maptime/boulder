For 2018, Maptime Boulder is planning on meeting the first Thursday of EVERY month!

EXCEPT for our first meeting of 2018, because your organizers are both away/busy... so:

WEDNESDAY, Feb. 7th in the Flatirons Rm. on the second floor.

We'll start with a fun session of map origami while we discuss the topics we want to investigate. Dig through car door stashes and bring old maps, silly tourist brochures with cartoon pathways and what-have-you for folding into art! Fun times. We'll provide some suggested folding instructions.

Also bring suggestions for topic sessions we should host this year!!!

Do you want to:

- Get an introduction to R?

- Share secret cartography tricks?

- Jump in on some HOTOSM validating?

- Explore 3D mapping?

- What else?

Let us know and we'll start stacking up ideas and volunteers that may want to lead a Maptime for our Thursday meetings. Share your curiosity and your knowledge!

Best,

Your Maptime Boulder Team

p.s. If you're a die-hard Maptimer and Thursdays don't work for you, please let us know.
