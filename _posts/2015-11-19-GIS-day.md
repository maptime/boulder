title: Humanitarian Mapping in OpenStreetMap for GIS Week
rsvp: http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-Boulder/events/226410045/
---

This meeting we'll celebrate GIS week by doing some humanitarian mapping using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform. OSM is a global volunteer-led effort to produce a free and open map of the world. In recent years it has been used to create maps in support a number of major disaster response efforts. 

Beginners and experts alike are welcome. 

Please bring a laptop
