The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) has activated and is currently responding to Hurricane Matthew, you can read more about this important work [here](https://hotosm.org/updates/2016-10-08_hurricane_matthew_update)

For Maptime this week, we'll help work on the top tasks for Hurricane Matthew: [http://tasks.hotosm.org/](http://tasks.hotosm.org/)

New to OpenStreetMap? Perfect! Experienced in humanitarian mapping? Perfect!  

This will be an interactive, hands-on Mapathon, so please bring a computer to participate. Beginners welcome!

To learn more about remote tracing in OpenStreetMap, see the [remote tracing guide here] (http://learnosm.org/en/coordination/remote-tracing/)

Look forward to seeing everybody Wednesday!

PS: Some people really enjoy using a separate, external mouse instead of a trackpad for this type of work, so consider bringing one if you have one!
