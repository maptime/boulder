On this off-week meeting, the co-founder of [Falling Fruit](http://fallingfruit.org/) will be talking about this project as well as some work looking at rooftop solar capacity (which will be a nice follow-up to the Digital Globe presentation on 4/21!)

This is a combined meeting with a geo-spatial analysis course at the University, so we will have a good crowd, hope everyone can join us to learn about mapping the Urban Harvest!
