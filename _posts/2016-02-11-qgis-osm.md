OpenStreetMap + QGIS! It's an Open Data and Open Source Software Fiesta!

At this event we'll be taking a deeper look at what (and who!) make up OSM data.

We'll be using QGIS to explore and visualize the data, and you'll walk away with a map of your hometown!

This will be a hands-on event, so please bring your laptop with [QGIS installed](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html)
