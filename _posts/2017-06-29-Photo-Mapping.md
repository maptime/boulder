With [State of the Map US](http://2017.stateofthemap.us) happening in Boulder this fall, we're teaming up with Christopher Beddow of [Mapillary](htp://mapillary.com) to do a Mapillary workshop and increase the photo coverage of Boulder!

Mapillary is a platform for crowd-sourcing street-level imagery. Anyone can create high quality geo-referenced imagery by installing the app and taking a walk with a GPS enabled camera or smart phone.

We'll meet at the library, learn about the project, determine a mapping route, and then pair up to walk the routes and collect imagery.

Chris is also bringing a handful of 360 cameras we can use!

After, we'll return to the library to upload the imagery, eat pizza, and learn about the capabilities of the API.

This is a hands on workshop and demo for everyone. All levels of mapping experience are encouraged to attend!
