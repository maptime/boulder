We're going to be artsy this month! We'll use OSM data to create screen-print designs!!! You can use these to make your own T-shirts, skirts, pillows or whatever you'd like!

Come with tools to be able to get OSM data into a graphics file, like a laptop loaded with [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) and the [QuickOSM plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QuickOSM/), if you want to dive in. Or just maybe a sketch pad if you want to be inspired and play with ideas to work on later. For an example of our target end file formats, take a look at this [site](https://www.threadbird.com/file-prep).

And yes, that's a picture of a cake... you can screen print cakes, I've heard... there just might be cake.
