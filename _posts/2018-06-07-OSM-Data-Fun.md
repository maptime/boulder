We're going to be artsy this month! We'll use OSM data to create screen-print designs!!! You can use these to make your own T-shirts, skirts, pillows or whatever you'd like! Many people are putting OSM data on clothing, posters, etc. Let's look at some simple ways to create these graphics with QGIS.

Come with tools that enable you to get OSM data into graphics files, like a laptop loaded with QGIS and the QuickOSM plugin. We'll collectively figure out fun ways to do this. Or bring just a sketch pad if you want to be inspired and play with ideas on paper to work on later. For inspiration, look at what others have done printing OSM data on clothes: [http://maponshirt.com](http://maponshirt.com), [https://flowingdata.com/2014/12/03/map-print-clothing/](https://flowingdata.com/2014/12/03/map-print-clothing/)

And yes, that's a picture of a cake... you can screen print cakes, I've heard... there just might be cake.
