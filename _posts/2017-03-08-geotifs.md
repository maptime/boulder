Faking the coordinates: Using slippy map tools to create interactive visualizations.

What more can we do with mapping libraries beyond making interactive maps? By embedding coordinates into any image, we can turn it into map tiles and use the power of [leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com) to enable interaction: zooming, panning, etc.

Example: Explore this Hi-res image of Mars: [http://maptime.io/boulder/examples/geotif.html](http://maptime.io/boulder/examples/geotif.html) (image credit: NASA)

At this meetup, we will embed high resolution images with geographic coordinates, turn them into map tiles and then use Leaflet/Mapbox.js to interact with them.

We will have a handful of high resolution images already geo-encoded, but if you would like to use a your own image, please bring it and we will encode and upload it.

Everyone is welcome! There will be example code to download and play with, by the end of the evening, everyone will walk away with a completed map and a new skill!
